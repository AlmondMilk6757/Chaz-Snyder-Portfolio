                <h3>Video Game Design Project</h3>
                <p>This game is called "Eternal Moth and Bee". It's a adventure game where you play as a Bee with your Moth friend. The problem is that there's a curse that was released at the begining from two of the bosses fighting. Your objective is to travel throughout the map and fight bosses collecting fragments leading you to the main boss while comepleting side quest to collect more items and relics to become stronger. This teaches survival and some math with the hp and dmg system when battling.</p>

                <h4> Scratch Project </h4>
                <p>We made a project using the program "Scratch". I chose to make a slider game. So basically what you're trying to do is catch falling objects that coming from a random point at the top. To make it a bit harder i increased the speed of the falling for it to be more fun. I chose a crab as the catcher on a beach and a puffer fish as what's being caught because it matched. When you catch something, it will respond with a "ding" and also add +1 to your score in the top left. Here is the link to my game: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/801664415</p>
